# HuginSample
This repository provides a sample image source for the Panorama photo stitcher - [Hugin](http://hugin.sourceforge.net/download/).
People that want to learn about creating [360 degree panoramas e.g. with AFrame](https://aframe.io/examples/showcase/sky/) can use this [set of sample images](https://github.com/niebert/HuginSample/archive/master.zip) to play around with [Hugin](http://hugin.sourceforge.net/download/).
* Create a panorama with Hugin
* Fix missing areas in the panorama and correct the projection with [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/downloads/)

 See the [Final result of your efforts in AFrame](https://niebert.github.io/HuginSample)

## Hugin
* Download [Hugin](http://hugin.sourceforge.net/download/)
* Install Hugin on your Operating System
* Load all the JPG images in the folder ___/durlach_saumarkt___ which are a bunch of JPG images of a market place in the town Karlsruhe-Durlach in Germany.
* Let Hugin align all the images for you (depending on the number of images and the performance of you computer it takes few minutes until this process is performed)
* Save the panorama to your local harddrive.
* You will see that the generated image is generated up-side-down. You can easily fix that by rotation of the output with you image editing software (e.g. [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/downloads/))

## Spherical (equirectangular) Images for AFrame
If you want to play around with equirectangular images and view them in Aframe check the [MediaWiki Commons Images of equirectangular projections](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Equirectangular_projection). Please cite the authors when you used the images.

## Fixing the Panorama
### Fixing the Gimp Output for AFrame 360 Degree Panorama
* If you use the panorama in AFrame scale the image in the vertical y-axis. A blank area at bottom of the Hugin output panorama should appear.
* The blank area at the botton is approximately 1/5 of the total height of the image.
* After exporting the image with GIMP and using in  [360 degree panoramas in AFrame](https://aframe.io/examples/showcase/sky/) on the ground you will see a white circle. This circle can be covered the GIMP Clone Tool.

### Fixing Missing Images in the Panorama with [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/downloads/)
In the collection of images from the Durlachsome areas of the sky and from the ground are missing. Due to changes in light it was impossible to collect the missing images later.

The missing areas in the panorama are
* in the sky and
* on the ground

Use clone in [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/downloads/) to fix the missing areas from the sky
* Copy some area from the ground and scale it and use it for the missing center on the ground
* Blend the scale images with image environment with "clone" in GIMP (see [Youtube Video about Clone Tool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsjGFadLtA8))
